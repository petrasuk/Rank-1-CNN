# Code for Rank-1-CNN 

rank-1    : the code of the Rank-1 network on the MNIST dataset. 

Here, we are testing on the same network structure as in the training stage.
However, as we mentioned in the paper, in the test time we can filter the input
with consecutive 1-D filters, where the 1-D filters are the trained 1-D vectors p, q, and t
in the code.
